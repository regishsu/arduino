  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int led = 13;
int i = 0;
// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  i = 1 - i;
  digitalWrite(led, i);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(250);               // wait for a second
}
